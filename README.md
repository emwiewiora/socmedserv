**Notes/Thoughts:**
This project is the biggest project that I have ever attempted.  <br>
Most of what is covered during this tutorial is my first time seeing it. <br>
WHat interested me in this project was its interaction with MangoDB.  I have a strong intrest in learning how to connect DBs to web projects.<br>
This project will take me a while to complete. I cant type that fast while listening, learning, and comprehending the material.  I have already do a lot of pause and rewind to insure i have coded it correctly and that i under stand what it is doing.<br>
It would easy to clone the repo, but I would not understand what it is doing at the code level and learning is the whole point.<br>
